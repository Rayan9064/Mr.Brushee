## Mr. Brushee ‚Äî Portable Shoe Cleaner (Next.js storefront)

This repository contains the frontend for "Mr. Brushee", a small e-commerce storefront built with Next.js and React. The site implements a simple product checkout flow using Stripe Checkout, collects basic customer and shipping information, and includes server routes for creating checkout sessions and handling payment success redirects.

The design was implemented from a Figma reference and the project contains responsive layouts and assets for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.

## What this website is

- A marketing + storefront site for the "Mr. Brushee" portable shoe cleaner.
- Product page(s) with a Stripe Checkout flow (hosted Stripe Checkout session).
- Basic pages for success and cancel flows after payment.
- Static and media assets under `public/` used for hero, product, and marketing content.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) ‚Äî server and client components
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Stripe (official Node library) for payments
- SendGrid / Nodemailer (present as dependencies / commented utilities) for transactional email (optional)
- Google APIs / Google Sheets (commented utility for optional spreadsheet logging)

Key dependencies visible in `package.json`:

- `next` 15.x, `react` 19
- `stripe` (server-side Stripe SDK)
- `@sendgrid/mail`, `nodemailer` (email utilities are present but commented)
- `googleapis` (commented - optional Google Sheets integration)

## Payment gateway

This project uses Stripe Checkout. The server route at `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` creates a Checkout Session with the following highlights:

- Card payments via Stripe Checkout
- Billing address and phone collection enabled
- Shipping address collection limited to US, CA, IN, GB
- A single hard-coded product (Mr. Brushee) with adjustable quantity and a unit amount of $20.00 (2000 cents)
- Redirects back to `Success` and `Cancel` pages using `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

Environment variables required for payments and other integrations are documented in the next section.

## Design reference

The UI and layouts were built to match a Figma design provided by the client (Figma file not included in this repo). Use the `public/` images (Hero, Product, Features) as assets mapped from the Figma screens. When adding screenshots to this README, use the filenames suggested below and keep them in a `screenshots/` folder at the project root.

## Quick demo

### Gallery (replace the images with your own)

Desktop / Tablet / Mobile screenshots can be added individually. I removed the table layout to avoid rendering issues ‚Äî use simple image embeds instead.

## Screenshots & guidelines

- Place screenshots in `./screenshots/` with the suggested filenames:
  - `desktop-home.png` (1440√ó900)
  - `tablet-home.png` (1024√ó768)
  - `mobile-home.png` (375√ó812)

```

## Deployment

Recommended: Vercel ‚Äî Connect the repo, add environment variables and deploy. Vercel auto-detects Next.js.

Manual build & run:

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## Optional extras / notes

- `src/utils/sendEmail.ts` and `src/utils/googleSheets.ts` contain commented helper code for transactional emails and sheet logging. They need API keys and a service account JSON (for Google Sheets).
- Consider moving product metadata (price, images) out of the checkout route into a shared config or CMS for easier updates.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Ideas:

- Add tests for API routes
- Extract product config into a JSON or CMS
- Implement a webhook to verify Stripe payments and trigger emails/logging

---

If you want, I can:

- Add the `screenshots/` folder and generate simple placeholder images.
- Wire SendGrid email flow or Google Sheets logging (requires API keys and service account file).
